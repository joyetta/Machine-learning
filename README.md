# Machine-learning

a collection of machine learning projects I've worked on over the last couple of weeks. 

K-Means Clustering: in this project, I used the K-Means Clustering algorithm with the mall customers dataset. In addition I also did some exploratory data analysis to thoroughly understand the dataset. The main libraries used are: pandas and numpy for numerical analysis, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualisation, and the sklearn libraries for data pre-processing and the machine learning algorithm. 


HR Data - Decision Tree: I used a specialist HR dataset for this model. There is a comprehensive visualisation on my Tableau Public account which can be accessed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joyonoretta/viz/HRDataAnalysis_16541717151000/HR. 
This model uses the decision tree algorithm to identify the characteristics of employees who would leave the company.
