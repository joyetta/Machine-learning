# Machine-learning

a collection of machine learning projects I've worked on over the last couple of weeks. 

K-Means Clusstering: in this project, I used the K-Means Clustering algorithm with the mall customers dataset. In addition I also did some exploratory data analysis to thoroughly understand the dataset. The main libraries used are: pandas and numpy for numerical analysis, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualisation, and the sklearn libraries for data pre-processing and the machine learning algorithm.
